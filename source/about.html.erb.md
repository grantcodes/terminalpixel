# About Me

<img class="freedom" src="../img/scottish-flag.png" alt="The Flag of Scotland">

I am a proudly Scottish web designer and developer.

I create thoroughly modern websites using the latest and greatest technologies. I believe that everything I build should be accessible on every device imaginable, including future ones. I make sure all my websites work on any sized device.

## Keeping Things Simple

I pride myself in keeping things simple in everything I do, I create simply beautiful websites and don't confuse things by using a bunch of technical jargon or developing over complicated solutions for basic problems.

I don't offer any unnecessary services that someone else will likely be able to do better, I don't rip you off for hosting, I can recommend you my [favourite company](http://www.webfaction.com/signup?affiliate=terminalpixl) and set it all up for you.

## Doing Things Right

I take pride in my work. I don't do rush jobs &mdash; I take my time and thoroughly think through problems in order to deliver excellent solutions. The general thinking is that if I'm not proud to call a product my own and sing and shout about it then it still needs improving.
