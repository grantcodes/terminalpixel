[DuckDuckGoog](http://www.duckduckgoog.com/) is a search engine that is based off [DuckDuckGo](http://www.duckduckgo.com/) and combines with good old [google](http://www.google.com/) to make a search engine that everyone should be using.

## !Bangs

!Bangs are DuckDuckGo's killer feature. Basically they are shortcuts to perform specific searches, so in a web development world typing `!gh boilerlate` will search for "boilerplate" on GitHub and `!jq on` will search for "on" in the jQuery documentation.

There are literally [**hundreds** of them](https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html). And it's not just limited to web developement, you can search maps, amazon, images, recipes, dictionaries, twitter and basically anything else you can think of.

I previously used to set up keywords in my browser to perform quick searches but using DuckDuckGo takes out all the hassle of setting the up on every machine and it has way more than I could ever be bothered to add manually.

A lovely little extra is that if you just type the !bang with no search term it will just take you to the site. I use it fairly regularly as shortcuts that my browser won't mess with.

## Where does the Goog come in?

The one downfall of DuckDuckGo is that it's default search results are just not as good as Google's usually are.

So all DuckDuckGoog does is redirect the default search to Google and keeps all the wonderful !bangs intact. The best of both worlds.

## How to use it

I was going to write a little how to get started guide but [DuckDuckGoog do a far better job themselves](http://www.duckduckgoog.com/browser).
