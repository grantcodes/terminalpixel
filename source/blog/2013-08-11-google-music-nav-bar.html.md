With the recent release of [Google Music All Access](https://play.google.com/store/music) in the UK I decided to jump on the early adopters bandwagon to get the discount price.

I've used the jQuery Color (LINK ME) plugin to apply transparency to the nav background color, using `opacity` may have been easier but it would have required extra markup somewhere so as not to make the text transparent as well.
