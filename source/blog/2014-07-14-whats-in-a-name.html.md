I always get asked about Terminal Pixel. What does it mean? Why did I choose it?

It turns out it's not just a silly name.

## Why have a business name?

Terminal Pixel is just me. I'm not a company, I'm just a sole trader so I could just use [grant-richmond.com](http://www.grant-richmond.com) as my base for everything but I decided against that for a number of reasons:

### 1. Recognisability

I think chances are that someone is more likely to remember my business logo and strange name than just my own name.

### 2. Flexibility

It gives me options. I could expand to become more than a one man show and keep the name.

### 3. Separation

Maybe someone doesn't care about what TV I'm watching or what I'm eating. Having a business social media account in addition to my personal one lets people ignore the stuff they're not interested in.

## Why Terminal Pixel?

There are 3 reasons for the name:

1. It's a play on the term "dead pixel" which is a common thing on LCD screens and sounds much cooler than it is.
2. The days of sizing things in pixels is gone. It's all about fluid units.
3. I am a big terminal user. So many useful tools...


So there you have it, it is slightly more than just an interesting name.
